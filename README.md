# RelentlessSMS
An SMS Repeater, designed to send multiple random messages as an SMS message. Written in Python, it uses the Textbelt.com API. 
1. Put in the target phone number
2. Select the number of messages you want to send
3. 
4. Select the speed which you want the messages sent in seconds
5. Click Send.

The first message is your personal one. After that is sent, the app will cycle through several random gibberish messages. If you send 100 messages, it will cycle through them. Each sent message will display in the window. Messages will be 160 characters or less. Toll free numbers are not allowed and the app assumes you are calling USA or Canada or any other +1 dialing country.

The logo is located on the C: drive. It's called logo.png. It's a simple circle logo generated in OpenAI with a transparent background. If there is no logo there, the script will ignore it and continue.
